### What do international students study?(work in progress)

The data of international students admitted to [National Chengchi University國立政治大學](https://www.nccu.edu.tw)(2021,n=261) are analyzed.

By department

```{r}
dataset <- read.xlsx("NCCU_2021.xlsx","Sheet1",header=TRUE)
dataset <- dataset %>% mutate(Department = gsub("[^A-Za-z. &()]","",Department),
                              Degree = gsub("[^A-Za-z. &()]","",Degree))

dataset %>%
  count(Department, sort=TRUE) %>%
  # mutate(Department = str_remove(Department,"[^A-Za-z. &()]")) %>%
  mutate(Department = str_remove(Department,"Department of |Dept. of ")) %>%
  mutate(Department = paste(Department,n,sep="\n")) %>%
  treemap(index="Department",
      vSize="n", title="Department"
  )
knitr::kable(
dataset %>%
  group_by(Department) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  mutate(Department = str_remove(Department,"Department of |Dept. of ")) %>%
  mutate( "%" = round(count / sum(count) * 100 ,1))
) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

By degree

```{r}
dataset %>%
  count(Degree, sort=TRUE) %>%
  mutate(Degree=paste(Degree,n,sep="\n")) %>%
  treemap(index="Degree",
      vSize="n", title="Degree"
  )
knitr::kable(
dataset %>%
  group_by(Degree) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  mutate( "%" = round(count / sum(count) * 100 ,1))
) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

Degree and Department

The height of rectangular indicates the number of students. The width of the line indicates the number of students between connected rectangular.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,  fig.align = "center", fig.cap="National Chengchi University"}
# prefix <- "NCCU"
dataset <- dataset %>%
  mutate(Department = str_remove(Department,"Department of |Dept. of "))
mSankey(dataset,prefix,"Degree","Department")
```

```{r child = 'Menu.Rmd'}
```

Note:

1. "Admitted' international student indicates someone who has received an acceptance letter from the university.
2. The accuracy of results would be increased if data of ‘enrolled’ international students are analyzed.
